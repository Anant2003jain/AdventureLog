# Installation

# Docker üêã

Docker is the preferred way to run AdventureLog on your local machine. It is a lightweight containerization technology that allows you to run applications in isolated environments called containers.
**Note**: This guide mainly focuses on installation with a linux based host machine, but the steps are similar for other operating systems.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine/server. You can learn how to download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Getting Started

Get the `docker-compose.yml` file from the AdventureLog repository. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) or run this command to download it directly to your machine:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/main/docker-compose.yml
```

## Configuration

Here is a summary of the configuration options available in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

### Proxy Container (nginx) Configuration

In order to use media files in a production environment, you need to configure the `nginx` container to serve the media files. The container is already in the docker compose file but you need to do a few things to make it work.

1. Create a directory called `proxy` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Create a file called `nginx.conf` in the `proxy` directory.
3. Add the following configuration to the `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location /media/ {
        alias /app/media/;
    }
}
```

## Running the Containers

To start the containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
