# Docker üêã

Docker is the preferred way to run AdventureLog on your local machine. It is a lightweight containerization technology that allows you to run applications in isolated environments called containers.
**Note**: This guide mainly focuses on installation with a linux based host machine, but the steps are similar for other operating systems.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine/server. You can learn how to download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Getting Started

Get the `docker-compose.yml` file from the AdventureLog repository. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) or run this command to download it directly to your machine:

::: tip

If running on an ARM based machine, you will need to use a different PostGIS Image. It is recommended to use the `tobi312/rpi-postgresql-postgis:15-3.3-alpine-arm` image or a custom version found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/tobi312/rpi-postgresql-postgis/tags). The AdventureLog containers are ARM compatible.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanmorley15/AdventureLog/main/docker-compose.yml
```

## Configuration

Here is a summary of the configuration options available in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
