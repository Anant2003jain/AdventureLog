# Installation with Unraid

AdventureLog is available in the Unraid Community Applications store. You can install it by searching for `AdventureLog` in the Community Applications store, where you will find the frontend and the backend, the database can be found by searching `PostGIS`.

Community Applications Page for AdventureLog: [AdventureLog on CA Store](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=AdventureLog)
Community Applications Page for PostGIS: [PostGIS on CA Store](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=PostGIS)

## Installation Configuration

It is recommended to install the applications in the order of these instructions.

Also insure they are all on the same custom network so they can communicate to one another, you can create one by running the following command in your command line with example being set to your wanted name. This network will then showup for selection when making the apps/containers.
```bash
docker network create example
```

## Database

- To find the Database Application, search for `PostGIS` on the Unraid App Store and fill out the fields as shown below
- Network type should be set to your custom network
- Change the repository version to `postgis/postgis:15-3.3`
- Ensure that the POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD are set in the PostGIS container, if not then add them as custom variables, the other variables are irrelevant for this setup and should be removed.

## Backend

- Network type should be set to your custom network
- **Note:** If you're running the server in a docker network that is other than "host" (for example "bridge") than you need to add the IP of the host machine in the CSRF Trusted Origins variable instead of using localhost, this is only necessary when accessing locally, otherwise you will use the domain name.

## Frontend

- By default, the frontend connects to the backend using `http://server:8000`. This will work if both the frontend and backend are on the same network and the backend is named server. Otherwise, youâ€™ll need to configure it to use the exposed port (default: 8016).
