## Backend

- Cache Configuration: This option is useful only if your appdata share is stored on a cache drive, which is used to speed up read/write operations for your containerized applications.
- Note: if your running the server in a docker network that is other than "host" (for example "bridge") than you need to add the IP of the host machine in the CSRF Trusted Origins variable.

## Frontend

- By default, the frontend connects to the backend using `http://server:8000`. This will work if both the frontend and backend are on the same network. Otherwise, youâ€™ll need to configure it to use the exposed port (default: 8016).
